# Open Wichita Project Ideas

Have an idea for a project? [Open an issue!](https://github.com/openwichita/project-ideas/issues/new)

Or, you can [browse around ideas that others have submitted](https://github.com/openwichita/project-ideas/issues). Feel free to ask questions, add comments, or just give a :+1: of approval if you find one you like.

This is a new change.
